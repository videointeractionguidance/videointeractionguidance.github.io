## What is VIG?

**Video Interaction Guidance (VIG)** is an intervention through which a practitioner aims to enhance communication within relationships. It works by engaging clients actively in a process of change towards realising their own hopes for a better future in their relationships with others who are important to them.

Practitioners are guided by the values and beliefs around respect and empowerment. These include a belief that people in troubled situations want to change, a respect for what clients are managing to achieve in their current difficulties, and a conviction that the power and responsibility for change resides within clients and their situations. It is most typically used for interactions between children of any age and adults, either parents or professionals, although it can also be used within pairs (or even groups) of adults.

## How is VIG delivered?

Video Interaction Guidance is an intervention where you will be guided to reflect on video clips of your own successful interactions.

- Before we take any recordings, we will have a general discussion during our initial meeting about you, your child, and your relationship. We will make some notes together using this electronic system. We may ask you to fill out some questionnaires electronically.
- During our discussions, we will negotiate your own goals and ask you what you want to change.
- After our initial meeting, we will find a time to film you interacting with your child and edit the clips to produce a short film that focuses on the what is working well.
- We will then meet for a review session, we will review the micro-analysis of successful moments, particularly those when you have responded in an attuned way to the childâ€™s action or initiative. Together we will analyse behaviour and explore yours and your child's feelings, thoughts, wishes and intentions. You might use non-verbal and verbal responses and sometimes this is only slight. This is ok as we will reflect collaboratively on the small things you are doing that is already contributing towards the achievement of your goals.
- Typically, we complete three cycles of filming and review sessions but this may be more or less.
- After we have completed all of our shared review sessions, we will have another general conversation as we did during our first meeting. We also might ask you to complete the same questionnaires again.
- We will then celebrate your success and make further goals for change.
