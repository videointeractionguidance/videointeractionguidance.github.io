        ## Practitioners
        Below are some useful documents and videos to help you get started with the DCS and entering VIG data. 


        <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact AVIGuk </strong>
          <p>AVIG will support your organisation with training on the use of the
        DCS. They will also ensure that your Information Governance
        teams approve your use of the DCS. Contact the DCS team at
        dcs@videointeractionguidance.net.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Complete Training</strong>
          <p>AVIGuk provides self-guided training on DCS use through available
        on the dcs landing pages. There are also online workshops held
        throughout the year. If your organisation has a number of
        practitioners we can arrange a bespoke course. Our training
        covers important information on data security and how to get the
        most out of using the DCS with clients.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sign Practitioner Consent Form</strong>
          <p>It is important that you consent to some personal data, like name
        and work email address, being stored on DCS. You should also
        read and acknowledge the Terms and Conditions of Use. These
        are combined in one online form that only needs to be completed
        once.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Obtain Client Consent</strong>
          <p>It is important that clients understand what data will be stored in
        the DCS and that they consent to this. Signed paper copies of
        consent forms are stored by your organisation, separate to the
        DCS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Input Data</strong>
          <p>You are ready to use the DCS – a safe, ﬂexible and eﬃcient tool to
        support your VIG practice and evidence its eﬃcacy.</p>
        </li>

        data to be shared with them. Accounts should be created on
        Kobo's EU server: https://eu.kobotoolbox.org/accounts/
