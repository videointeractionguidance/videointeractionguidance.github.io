title: Terms & Conditions of Use

Please read the terms and conditions listed below carefully. When you sign the consent form you will be asked to acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms and conditions.

- We ask that you complete a training course or introduction session with the VIG-DCS team before you use the system. This may be live with the research team, or self-directed via AVIGuk's learning platform. 
- You must only use the VIG-DCS with authorisation from your organisation. If you are in the NHS, this will be your Information Governance Team. When you have been authorised, we will add your service to a drop-down list to allow you to input data in the system. 
- You must only use the VIG-DCS with a client following their informed consent. You can find the client consent form on the 'Consent Forms' page of the app. 
- You must use and retain the client consent form in line with your organisation's policies and procedures. AVIGuk does not retain a copy of the client consent form. 
- The consent form for the VIG Data Collection System, which you will find on the web-app is distinct to the consent form for VIG generally. Both must be completed and stored as you normally would in your organisation. 
- If your client chooses not have their data in the system, we recommend you have a printed copy of the meeting structure and any other printed copies of standardised measures you would typically use for VIG. This can be found on the AVIGuk learning platform. 
- It is crucial that you use a unique identifier when inputting your clients' data to ensure the data we store is pseudo-anonymised. An identifier is produced within the system that you can use, or you can create your own identifier as long as it contains no information about clients, such as their initials or date of birth. 
- It is your responsibility to ensure the unique identifier is kept confidential and separate from your clientâ€™s records. 
- You must use the same unique identifier when inputting data for different meetings with the same client. This is essential for us to evaluate VIG as we will need to connect their data from different time points. 
- It is also your responsibility to make sure no identifying information is included in the questions with free-text fields. For example, when the client tells you about their relationship with their child, you can write 'my child' in place of the child's name. 
- We recommend you use a device associated with your workplace when using the system. It is your responsibility to ensure the settings on your browser do not save the responses from previous clients. It may be that you need to clear your web-browsers cache/history before each new client or you can use a private or incognito window. 
- You must use your work email address when inputting data. Please do not use  personal email accounts. You can save a PDF copy of client's responses as you complete the form. 
- If you conduct VIG in more than one role, you must use the email address associated with the service that you client is engaged with. 
- It is your responsibility to store the data you save in line with your workplaces' policies and procedures and to adhere to data protection law.
