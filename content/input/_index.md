## Before Inputting Data

1. It is essential that you first have contact with AVIGuk. You will need to complete some self-directed training and your organisation will need to agree to you using the system.
2. Please make sure both you and your client have signed a consent form. You can find these on the 'Consent Forms' tab (the practitioner signs an electronic copy and the client signs a paper copy in line with your organisations' policies and procedures).
3. As the practitioner, you should also familiarise yourself and sign the terms and conditions before using the system. This can be found alongside the practitioner consent form.
4. The 'About VIG' tab has an overview of VIG, which you may find helpful to review with your client first.
